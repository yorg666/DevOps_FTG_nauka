Changing Server Port
If you use the TeamCity server Windows installer, you can set the port to be used during installation.
If you use the .war distribution, refer to the manual of the application server used.
Use the following instructions to change the port if you use the .tar.gz distribution.
If another application uses the same port as the TeamCity server, the TeamCity server (Tomcat server) won't start and this will be identified by "Address already in use" errors in the server logs or server console.

To change the server port, in the <TeamCity Home>/conf/server.xml file, change the port number in the HTTP/1.1 connector (here the port number is 8111):
<Connector port="8111" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               connectionTimeout="20000"
               redirectPort="8443"
               enableLookup="false"
               useBodyEncodingForURI="true"
        />
To apply the changes, restart the server.
If you run another Tomcat server on the same machine, you might need to also change other Tomcat server service ports (search for "port=" in the server.xml file).
If you want to use the https:// protocol, it should be enabled separately and the process is not specific to TeamCity, but rather for the web server used (Tomcat by default). See also Using HTTPS to access TeamCity server
